.Sh NAME
.Nm stlinfo
.Nd Reads an STL file and prints information about the object or a text
representation of the object in the file.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op -t | -e
infile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents 
.Ql $Revision: 3.1 $
of the 
.Nm
program. Its purpose is to print human readable information about the STL file
or a human readable version of the STL file.

First, the STL file is parsed. Both binary and text STL file can be read, but
any color information in binary STL files is discarded since this is not
standardized. 

By default the program prints information about the STL file. This includes
the name of the solid, the number of facets, unique vertices and normal
vectors, the object's extents and the center and mean points of the object.
If the '-e' option is used, all the edges of the facets are checked for edges
that are only used in one facet, indicating an open surface. For large models
this is a long operation.

If the '-t' option is used, however, a listing of the STL file in text format
is produced instead.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Pp
There is an error which the program cannot ignore, and which will terminate
the program.
.Bl -tag -width "foo"
.It The file '...' cannot be read or parsed. Exiting.
If a given input file cannot be read, or if the file is not recognized as an
STL file, this error is produced, and the program is terminated with exit code
1.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The 
.Nm
program requires the Python interpreter. It was written for version 2.7, but
should be able to work with 3.x after fixing with
.Xr 2to3 .

.Sh HISTORY
The origin of this software was found in the desire of the author to render 3D
CAD models using the POV-ray raytracer. The first effort produced the
.Xr stl2pov 1
program, written in C. 
.Pp
Later the author converted that program to Python as a learning
experience. This resulted in a more re-usable version of the software to parse
STL files as a Python module. Adding this front-end for outputting a summary
or text representation then became trivial.
